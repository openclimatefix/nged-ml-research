# Calibration and uncertainty: research plan

**A lower number in the "Priority" column runs sooner.**

## Priority

| Id | Question | Priority | Waits for | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 483 | Does a widening or table P make the tails of the first-release demand candidates honest? | 1 | Experiment 470 | Planned |
| 492 | Can two constants per metering group replace table P for the first-release demand candidates? | 2 | Experiment 483 | Planned |
| [P14](#p14-coupling) | Which coupling step, ECC-Q or the Schaake shuffle, gives better coherence scores at short and long leads? | 5 | The scoring harness and experiment 00016 | Deferred; no consumer needs coherent members yet |

## Proposals in detail

### P14: coupling

**The coupling step turns calibrated quantiles back into 51 coherent members.** The arms are ECC-Q
with the interpolation, tail, and tie rules of the [staged forecast roadmap
page](https://openclimatefix.github.io/nged-substation-forecast/roadmap/staged-probabilistic-forecast/),
and the Schaake shuffle, scored by the
variogram score and the CRPS of summed solar farms in a weather cell, by lead band.
